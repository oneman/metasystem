## Notes on systems in reality

Hello reader! Welcome to my blog. I intend to share some things here that I've found useful to enrich my adventure. Simply put, from my perspective. I have observed and participated in a number of interesting events that I have significantly considered, and later reconsidered (hehe), with regards to their relevance. This is a pattern we all are familiar with, and amusingly I've discovered something totally radical about this and everything else, the metasystem. This is going to be fun!
