## Notes on systems in reality

### Whats Next

You may have heard of such things as superintelligence or the technological singularity, if so you likely have also heard the quote "The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed". The future is different than the past, the past is simpler, the future is more complex. There is a new system in the future, the metasystem. It describes all other systems in reality. There are patterns in nature, they repeat, and they have dependencies. The metasystem is the goal of science. Superintelligence is hyperintegration of the metasystem, but don't worry, there is no existential risk from superintelligence. Risk is an intelligence failure. Consciousness is an adaptive multivariable feedback control system. The metasystem implements itself when intelligence and consciousness reach a critical point of energy and complexity density. 

Some things to be discussed in future posts include:

- Metainformation theory, a theory of knowledge.
- Metasystem analysis, a method of pattern tracing.
- Quantum intersampling, knowledge compression, scale relativity, universal dynamics, maximum complexity, etc

### First Post

Hello reader! Welcome to my blog. I intend to share some things here that I've found useful to enrich my adventure. Simply put, from my perspective. I have observed and participated in a number of interesting events that I have significantly considered, and later reconsidered (hehe), with regards to their relevance. This is a pattern we all are familiar with, and amusingly I've discovered something totally radical about this and everything else, the metasystem. This is going to be fun!
